Hello, I'm Marlon! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a programming student fascinated by technology and always in search of new things to learn. I'm at the beginning of my journey, studying Software Engineering at UDESC, but very excited to create and collaborate on amazing projects.

I'm currently focused on improving my skills in Java, exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. I have a great interest in software development and competitive programming and am always looking for ways to apply and improve what I learn in my course and in practical projects.

âœ¨ My Interests:

Backend Development: Exploring how things work behind the scenes.

Artificial Intelligence: Fascinated by the potential of these areas.

Problem Solving: I love challenges and finding efficient solutions.
